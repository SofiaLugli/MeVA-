# MeVA
The Metaphorical Visual Analogy (MeVA) task consisted in solving visual analogies of the kind _source domain : target domain :: source element : ?_ by
choosing the correct target element among three difficult _distractors_, varying in semantic domains and roles.
The MeVA dataset ended up consisting of 333 analogies, each composed of 7 images corresponding to a source domain, a target domain, a source element, and four target
element candidates within which, one is the correct target element and the other three are
the difficult distractors: e.g., battle : debate :: soldier : ? + [opponent, knowledge, patient, medicine].
